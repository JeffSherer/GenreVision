# GenreVision
SpotifyML is a machine learning project that predicts music genres using deep learning on album covers and machine learning on song metadata. It leverages TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn to compare the effectiveness of visual and textual features, incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, class balancing, and model evaluation.
